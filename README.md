## Component Playground ðŸŽ¨

### Purpose
The Component Playground is a powerful development tool designed to:
- Rapidly prototype and test UI components
- Showcase component variations
- Facilitate design reviews
- Aid in component development and testing

### Key Features
- **Component Visualization**: Display multiple variants of components
- **Interactive Testing**: Simulate different states and interactions
- **Development Navigation**: Easy screen switching for rapid iteration

### Navigation During Development

#### Screen Navigation
During development, all screens are configured with:
- Direct navigation buttons
- Back navigation buttons
- Consistent header styling

#### How to Use Navigation
1. **Component Playground Screen**
   - Provides buttons to navigate to all other screens
   - Demonstrates different component variants
   - Allows quick access to different parts of the app

2. **Screen-Specific Navigation**
   - Each screen has a "Back" button to return to the previous screen
   - Buttons to navigate between screens for quick testing

### Component Playground Workflow

#### Adding Components to Playground
1. Open `src/screens/ComponentPlaygroundScreen.tsx`
2. Import your new component
3. Add a section to showcase different variants:

```typescript
import NewComponent from '../components/NewComponent';

const ComponentPlaygroundScreen: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <ScrollView>
      <View style={styles.section}>
        <Text style={styles.sectionTitle}>New Component Variants</Text>
        
        <NewComponent variant="primary" />
        <NewComponent variant="secondary" />
        <NewComponent disabled />
      </View>
    </ScrollView>
  );
};
```

#### Best Practices
- Show multiple component states
- Include different prop combinations
- Add console logs to test interactions
- Use consistent styling sections

### Development Navigation Principles

#### Goals
- Minimize context switching
- Rapid screen and component testing
- Simplified development workflow

#### Navigation Strategies
- One-click access to any screen
- Consistent back navigation
- Clear, intuitive routing

### Disabling Development Navigation
To remove development navigation features:
1. Update `MainNavigator.tsx`
2. Remove development-specific routing
3. Set appropriate initial screen

## Additional Documentation

### State Management
- **React Context and Hooks**
  - Centralized state management using React Context API
  - Type-safe global state with TypeScript
  - Lightweight and performant solution

### Global State Structure
Our application state is managed through a comprehensive context system:
- **Authentication State**: User login, token management
- **Theme State**: Light/dark mode, color preferences
- **Location State**: User's geographic information

### Using the App Context
```typescript
// In any component
import { useAppContext } from './contexts/AppContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { state, dispatch } = useAppContext();

  // Access state
  const isLoggedIn = state.auth.isAuthenticated;
  const currentTheme = state.theme.mode;

  // Dispatch actions
  const handleLogin = (user, token) => {
    dispatch({ 
      type: 'LOGIN', 
      payload: { user, token } 
    });
  };

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'TOGGLE_THEME' });
  };
}
```

### Key Context Features
- Centralized state management
- Type-safe actions and state
- Easy to extend and modify
- No external dependencies
- Integrated with React's hooks system

### Testing
- **Testing Library:**
  - Using `@testing-library/react-native` and `@testing-library/jest-native` for component testing.
  - Jest is configured as the test runner.

### Linting and Formatting
- **ESLint and Prettier:**
  - Configured for code quality and style consistency.
  - Run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors.
  - Run `npm run format` to format code using Prettier.

### Continuous Integration
- **GitHub Actions:**
  - CI/CD pipeline configured for automated testing and deployment.
  - Deployment to Heroku on push to the main branch.

### Environment Variables
- **Configuration:**
  - Use `.env` files to manage environment-specific variables.
  - Ensure `.env` is included in `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive data from being committed.

## Monitoring and Scaling
- Set up monitoring tools to track app performance.
- Optimize database queries and use indexing for better performance.
- Implement caching strategies to improve response times.

## Security Best Practices
- Validate and sanitize inputs on both frontend and backend.
